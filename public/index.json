This is what i did I have MEGA sync installed on all my devices and the synced folder has the database which is a kbdx file which is read by the KeePassXC application everytime it loads. All you have to do is set the databases (existing) path to the synced_folder/passwords.kbdx on every machine. Now whenever you make changes (ie create, remove, update, delete) passwords. the passwords.kbdx file gets updated and then synced automatically across all your devices. It is secure because the passwords.kbdx file is encrypted and can only be accessed using the master password you have set.\nBonus tips on how to make a strong passwords. # Typically, there are 2 methods of password cracking; brute force and dictionary attacks. So,\nPick multiple words instead of single complex word: D0egc01n# is a bad password because this would get completely wrecked by a GPU cluster because that might be calculating as many as hundred billion hashes per second.\nPick words that have less chance of being in the dictionary: For instance kakarot illadelph chungus sussy baka is a good password because its chance of being in a dictionary are very unlikely.\nDont pick words specific to you.

Little did I know that when I jumped into the tech world and corporate dreams, I\u0026rsquo;d find myself stuck in its web. You see, I\u0026rsquo;m usually the type to shy away from centralized platforms and social media, preferring the shadows over the spotlight. But the demands of a tech job left me no choice but to dive into the LinkedIn abyss.\nLinkedIn seemed like a necessary evil I had to hug, but beneath its shiny surface lies a world of frustration and annoyance that I just can\u0026rsquo;t keep quiet about.\nThe Illusion of Professionalism: # LinkedIn loves to brag about being the pinnacle of professionalism. However, the reality often feels like a show. Shiny profiles with buzzwords and exaggerated job titles make it seem like everyone is a CEO, even if it\u0026rsquo;s just a one-person operation. This self-aggrandizement leads to the culture of comparison. As you scroll through profiles boasting achievements and titles, the seeds of self-doubt are planted. LinkedIn thrives on the \u0026lsquo;fake it till you make it\u0026rsquo; philosophy, with people exaggerating achievements and turning their profiles into works of fiction. Can we please bring back honesty and authenticity? In my quest for a job, I\u0026rsquo;ve realized one thing: in the corporate world, you\u0026rsquo;ve got to present yourself in a way that doesn\u0026rsquo;t entirely reflect who you are to make it through.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t even know. I just thought it sound cool.

Some folks, like myself, prefer to keep personal details, achievements, and experiences private.\nThe Endorsement Dilemma: # The virtual pats on the back. As meaningful as a participation certificate. The endorsement system feels more like a popularity contest than a genuine reflection of one\u0026rsquo;s abilities.\nConclusion # So in conclusion since you like rappers that\u0026rsquo;s killing that pussy, I\u0026rsquo;m killing myself.\n","date":"25 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/the-linkedin-struggle/","section":"Posts","summary":"Introduction # LinkedIn, the supposed networking haven for professionals promising career opportunities and connections.

There are concerns about whether these OSes are following the rules of open-source software licenses, especially the GNU General Public License (GPL). And I think it\u0026rsquo;s worth digging into this issue.\nMaya OS # Maya OS is an ubuntu based operating system developed by the Indian Defence Research and Development Organisation. Since MayaOS is ubuntu based, it operates under the GPL, which requires any derivative work to also adhere to the GPL terms. This mandates the availability of the source code to the public. However, the code is not publicly available, which i find concerning because it\u0026rsquo;s against the GPL\u0026rsquo;s rules for using GPL-licensed software.\nWhen i read about this, i tries to contact Ministry of IT, India through email. They responded with basically saying that the matter might fall under the purview of the Ministry of Defence. I wrote to their Public Grievance email too, but unfortunately they didnt respond.\nBhar OS: More like bhar me jaye OS # Similarly, BharOS, a mobile OS developed by IIT, Madras, is said to be designed for users who need strong privacy and security. However, leaked source code suggests that BharOS is mostly a copy of GrapheneOS with very few changes but ironically IIT Madras director claimed that it took them 1 year to develop the OS. This raises questions about whether BharOS is truly original and whether the claims of being \u0026ldquo;indigenous\u0026rdquo; are misleading.\nConclusion # These cases highlight possible license violations.

As a consaquence, they often lack the funcamental knowledge of how things actually work\nIntroduction # For instance, many CS students utilize VS Code with multiple extensions for code compilation and execution. This practice isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily detrimental, but a significant issue arises when these individuals lack fundamental knowledge of manual code compilation and terminal usage. They heavily rely on feature-rich IDEs without delving into the inner workings of the programming language they\u0026rsquo;ve been using for months.\nNow what to do # It is crucial to grasp concepts before delving into specific tools. Consider learning GPG as an example. Watching a tutorial on encrypting a file using GNUPG may allow you to execute the task, but without a basic understanding of encryption concepts, such as private and public keys, you won\u0026rsquo;t comprehend the process. The same principle applies to learning Linux. Start with reading documentation, understanding the history of Linux, decentralized systems, and the distinctions from other operating systems before diving into specific tools.\nRead the effin docs # Reading documentation should be your initial step when acquiring a new skill. Docs are crafted by project developers and serve as one of the best learning resources. Unfortunately, some individuals are oblivious to the existence of documentation. Relying solely on tutorials from platforms like YouTube without consulting the official documentation indicates a lack of fundamental understanding. Look at the source code # Explore free software repositories on platforms like GitHub or GitLab. Examine the source code to understand how a project is maintained, review pull requests, and analyze issues. Some users utilize open-source tools for years without ever inspecting the source code. Understanding the programming language of the software you use is a fundamental aspect of technical literacy.\nCompile program manually # Occasionally, manually compiling source code can enhance your understanding of package functionalities, build dependencies, and offer opportunities for software optimization. Refer to compilation instructions in the wiki or readme for valuable insights. Try to stick with the minimalist software # Opt for minimalist software over bloated proprietary alternatives. For example, when downloading large files with multiple connections, a minimal CLI tool like Axel can perform the task efficiently. Minimalist software tends to have concise documentation, making it easier to comprehend.\nAlso minimal software = small documentation = easier comprehension.\nConclusion # Emphasize conceptual learning before delving into specific tools. Acquiring a solid conceptual foundation makes learning tools more straightforward in the long run.\n","date":"23 May 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/concepts-vs-tools/","section":"Posts","summary":"Most people learn tools instead of leraning concepts first.

The linux community is vast, with numerous options (distros) to choose from, whichy leads to the paradox of choice. When faced with too many choices, new linux users tend to make either bad desicions or make fine desicions and feel disappointed about the results. Distro hopping # Everyone starts with ubuntu, then one starts to find a reason to switch to another distro (because their redditor friend told then ubuntu is for noobs and pros use arch) but in reality there is no noobie distro and no perfect distro. This is where the distro hoping starts, constantly switching from one distro to another in search of the \u0026ldquo;perfect one\u0026rdquo;. This search often leads to disappointment and frustration.\nHow to avoid paradox of choice # The best way to avoid the paradox of choice is to focus on purpose of using linux. One should realize that he is here to get things done and not get caught up in endless searches for the perfect distro and that there is no perfect distro . Each distro has its strengths and weaknesses.\nLets say if a person is using ubuntu and he does not like the default unity desktop environment. there is no need to switch to another distro and learn about a whole new package manager. You can just remove the defautlt DE and install a new one like KDE, mate, xfce. There is no need to switch unless you find something that your current distro cannot do that you need.\nAnother common example why many users switch is because they want a more efficient system. \u0026ldquo;Oh! im gonna install arch linux becuase its more minimal then i can save 2.6969 seconds of boot time. Faster boot time is not a significant advantage for most users and the learning curve of arch may not be worth the stitch for many users. Its important to consider the actual benifits of a distro before making a switch, rather than getting caught up in the hype of minor differences.\n","date":"14 March 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/paradox-of-choice/","section":"Posts","summary":"Introduction # Paradox of choice - why more is less is a book by american psychologist Barry Schawtz where he argues that eliminating consumers choices can greatly reduce indecisiveness and stress for shoppers.
