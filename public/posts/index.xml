      <description>Introduction # So, I ended up buying a new domain—mostly because it was super cheap. Figured I might as well use it for a year.
I also signed up for AWS Free Tier, which gives me 750 hours of EC2 usage per month for a whole year. Now that I’ve got both a domain and a VPS, I guess it’s time to become death, destroyer of idle servers.
I’ve set up a public Calibre server at calibre.</description>

      <description>Introduction # I&amp;rsquo;ve recently made some updates to my Auto Arch and Hyrpland Dotfiles scripts, aiming to streamline the Arch Linux installation process. While I initially thought about combining the two, I decided to keep them separate but interconnected. Now, the Auto Arch script automatically clones the Hyprland Dotfiles repository into the user&amp;rsquo;s home folder, providing a straightforward way to get both Arch Linux and the Hyprland configuration in one go.</description>

      <description>Introduction # Here is how i manage my passwords securely.
What I use # I use KeePassXC which is an offline and password manager. It is encrypted at all times and no data is stored on remote servers. It is also cross platform and open source of course (GPLV3).
How I Sync It Across My Devices # So one issue with this secure and offline password manager is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sync passwords across devices which is their motive and its upto the user to handle their passwords.</description>

      <description>Introduction # LinkedIn, the supposed networking haven for professionals promising career opportunities and connections. Little did I know that when I jumped into the tech world and corporate dreams, I&amp;rsquo;d find myself stuck in its web. You see, I&amp;rsquo;m usually the type to shy away from centralized platforms and social media, preferring the shadows over the spotlight. But the demands of a tech job left me no choice but to dive into the LinkedIn abyss.</description>

      <description>Introduction # I noticed something that raises some red flags about two recent &amp;ldquo;indigenous&amp;rdquo; operating systems by India, BharOS and MayaOS. There are concerns about whether these OSes are following the rules of open-source software licenses, especially the GNU General Public License (GPL). And I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth digging into this issue.
Maya OS # Maya OS is an ubuntu based operating system developed by the Indian Defence Research and Development Organisation.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/concepts-vs-tools/</guid>
      <description>Most people learn tools instead of leraning concepts first. As a consaquence, they often lack the funcamental knowledge of how things actually work
Introduction # For instance, many CS students utilize VS Code with multiple extensions for code compilation and execution. This practice isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily detrimental, but a significant issue arises when these individuals lack fundamental knowledge of manual code compilation and terminal usage. They heavily rely on feature-rich IDEs without delving into the inner workings of the programming language they&amp;rsquo;ve been using for months.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a to-the-point, no bullshit guide on why and how to install custom rom on any andorid device.
What is custom rom # Andorid is an open source project and every andorid smartphone company uses their own skin/ui for their phones, for example redmi uses miui, samsung uses one ui and so on to make them look diffent from their competetors. These roms are calles stock roms.
