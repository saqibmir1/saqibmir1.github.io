      <description>Introduction So, I ended up buying a new domain—mostly because it was super cheap. Figured I might as well use it for a year.
I also signed up for AWS Free Tier, which gives me 750 hours of EC2 usage per month for a whole year. Now that I’ve got both a domain and a VPS, I guess it’s time to become death, destroyer of idle servers.
I’ve set up a public Calibre server at calibre.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve recently made some updates to my Auto Arch and Hyrpland Dotfiles scripts, aiming to streamline the Arch Linux installation process. While I initially thought about combining the two, I decided to keep them separate but interconnected. Now, the Auto Arch script automatically clones the Hyprland Dotfiles repository into the user&amp;rsquo;s home folder, providing a straightforward way to get both Arch Linux and the Hyprland configuration in one go.</description>

      <description>Introduction Here is how i manage my passwords securely.
What I use I use KeePassXC which is an offline and password manager. It is encrypted at all times and no data is stored on remote servers. It is also cross platform and open source of course (GPLV3).
How I Sync It Across My Devices So one issue with this secure and offline password manager is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sync passwords across devices which is their motive and its upto the user to handle their passwords.</description>

      <description>Introduction I noticed something that raises some red flags about two recent &amp;ldquo;indigenous&amp;rdquo; operating systems by India, BharOS and MayaOS. There are concerns about whether these OSes are following the rules of open-source software licenses, especially the GNU General Public License (GPL). And I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth digging into this issue.
Maya OS Maya OS is an ubuntu based operating system developed by the Indian Defence Research and Development Organisation. Since MayaOS is ubuntu based, it operates under the GPL, which requires any derivative work to also adhere to the GPL terms.</description>

      <description>Hyprland is a dynamic tiling Wayland (a replacement for the X11 window system protocol and architectur) compositor based on wlroots.
Introduction I have used tiling window manager ever since i came to know about them (very recently really). I was using dwm which is based on xorg but since everybody was moving to hyprland i decided i should move to wayland too since it is modern and more efficient than xorg.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:42297/posts/paradox-of-choice/</guid>
      
      <description>Introduction There&amp;rsquo;s a book called The Paradox of Choice by Barry Schwartz. The idea is — more options can actually make people more stressed and indecisive. Sounds weird, but it’s real. And it shows up in the Linux world more than you’d think.
The number of Linux distros out there is insane. If you’re new, it’s easy to get lost. You either pick something random and hope for the best, or fall into a rabbit hole of forums and opinions trying to find “the best one.</description>

      <description>This is a list of all (almost) the software i use on my pc as well as on my phone.
My Setup PC Operating System: I use Arch Linux beacuse of its simplicity and KISS ( keep it simple, stupid!) philosophy. Arch linux has a rolling release model. It also has a large and active community, which means there is a lot of support available if you need it.
Terminal: Foot: I use this tiny program called foot as my terminal emulator.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a to-the-point, no bullshit guide on why and how to install custom rom on any andorid device.
What is custom rom Andorid is an open source project and every andorid smartphone company uses their own skin/ui for their phones, for example redmi uses miui, samsung uses one ui and so on to make them look diffent from their competetors. These roms are calles stock roms.
So custom is is essentially a custom skin or custom ui built and maintained by developers voluntarily.</description>
