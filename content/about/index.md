Greetings, mortal!. I am an outrageous concoction  of excessive self-conciousness and meloncholic tendencies, with a dash of quirkiness and a sprinkle of
        oddball charm. when i'm not busy staring at the wall and contemplating the futility of existence, you can usually find me binging on cat videos
        and tinkering with free and open source software.
